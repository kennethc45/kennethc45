I've been enjoying web development ever since I transitioned from pre-med to computer science during college. As someone who came from a track of memorizing an egregious amount of theory with little application, I've come to realize that I'm a hands on person. Not only do I learn best from applying what I've studied in practical settings, but that is also when I have the most fun! That is what attracted me to computer science. The opportunity to accomplish a task through the experimentation of different paths.
