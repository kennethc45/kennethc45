&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been enjoying web development ever since I transitioned from pre-med to computer science during college. As someone who came from a track of memorizing an egregious amount of theory with little application, I've come to realize that I'm a hands on person. Not only do I learn best from applying what I've studied in practical settings, but that is also when I have the most fun! That is what attracted me to computer science. The opportunity to accomplish a task through the experimentation of different paths. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I'm still early in my journey at Rice, I'm actively seeking for full-time positions in Full-Stack development or Dev-Ops. While I'm eager to continue my education, I also want to be able to apply my skills in industry to gain practical experience. Through my time working on my senior capstone with HEB, a local Texas grocery chain, I've come to enjoy learning the entire process of developing software. From creating the front-end and back-end to deploying on the cloud through the pipeline. I want to be versatile and be able to make an impact during any part, any stage. If you're hiring, let's chat on LinkedIn!
